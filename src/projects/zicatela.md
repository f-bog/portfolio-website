Probably my most favourite place to eat.

Zicatela specialises in handcrafting homemade, incredibly delicious, and authentic mexican food on the Gold Coast.
Their food will make you say "Muy bueno!" with your mouth full.

## Project Details

Single page Gatsby site. Made using styled components and making use of a plugin to pull posts from their Instagram.

Originally the website would automatically rebuild whenever a new post was made to their Instagram.

Unfortunately due to changes to the Instagram API, this is no longer the case.
