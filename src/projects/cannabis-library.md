Find and get info on Medicinal Cannabis Strains.

A simple React project that fetches data from an API using axios.js.

## Project Details

Created custom icons and mockups in Adobe (Illustratior & XD).

Implemented windowing with [react-window](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-window) in order to render a large list of complex components. Please check out this [blog post](https://praekiko.medium.com/what-is-windowing-also-i-have-heard-about-react-window-and-react-virtualized-c29dc843f4e0) for more information.

Setup a [proxy](https://github.com/frederickbogdanoff/medical-cannabis-library-backend) using node.js to hide the projects API key.

### Disclaimer

I do not use nor do I condone the use of illegal drugs and substances! The sole purpose of this application is to showcase my growing knowledge of React, and other tools used.

[The Strain Api](http://strains.evanbusse.com/) was used because I liked how the JSON data looked and I felt it would make for an interesting project.
