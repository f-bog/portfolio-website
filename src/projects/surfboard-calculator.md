Calculate your Surf Board volume based on weight and experience level.

## Project Details

Uses the [Guild Factor (GF)](https://magicseaweed.com/news/the-guild-factor-will-help-you-find-that-magic/10280/), the ratio is achieved by dividing the volume of a surfboard by the riderâ€™s weight, the ratio is then used in the opposite direction to give a rough estimate on correct surf board volume.

Ratios used:

Beginner = 0.43

Intermediate = 0.38

Expert = 0.36
