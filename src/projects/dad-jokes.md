Fetch Dad jokes and vote them up or down!

## Project Details

A simple React project that fetches dad jokes from an API, allows you to vote on them, and reorders the list accordingly.

Implemented local storage to keep results on refresh.

"Get more jokes!" button Fetches more jokes without duplicates.

Uses [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) to allow the list to reorder based on votes, whilst providing a neat animation.
